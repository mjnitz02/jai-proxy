"""The startup contract for an unusable data mount.

A container's `data/` is a bind mount whose host directory may be owned by a uid
the container does not run as. When that happens the operator must get the
server's one-line preflight report -- not a PermissionError traceback out of an
`import`, which names neither the mount nor the uid. That means nothing
constructed at import time may let a failed mkdir escape.
