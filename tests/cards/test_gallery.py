"""gallery_id generation and the read/ensure accessors -- the id
SillyTavern-CharacterLibrary keys a character's image gallery on.

The format is a contract with *their* code (12 chars from a 62-char alphanumeric
alphabet, in `data.extensions.gallery_id`), so it's pinned here. The other half
of the contract is that an existing id is never regenerated -- it's the link to a
gallery folder that may already hold images.
