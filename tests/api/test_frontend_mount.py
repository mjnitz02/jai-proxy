"""How the React client at the root is served (proxy/server.py).

The mount is conditional on `frontend/dist` existing, so these tests skip in a
checkout that has not run `make frontend-build` -- and in CI, where the Python
job never builds it. What they pin down is the behaviour that is easy to break
and invisible until a browser hits it: the SPA fallback, the registration order
that keeps the root catch-all from swallowing the API, and the prefix guard that
keeps a mistyped API path a 404 rather than a 200 full of HTML.
