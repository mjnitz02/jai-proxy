 * server-side, `proxy/api/v1/galleries.py`'s `bulk_delete_files`): a binned
 * file keeps its manifest entry claiming the source URL as downloaded, so a
 * plain "Localize media" pass still treats the card as complete and does not
 * go re-fetch it. Only a full rescan re-derives the URL list from scratch and
