 * it could parse. A 500 with an empty body — which is what an unhandled server
 * exception and a dead upstream both look like — arrives as *neither* `data`
 * nor `error`, and a query function that only tests `error` then returns
 * `undefined`, which TanStack Query reports as the useless "data is undefined".
 *
 * So the status is the thing to trust, and FastAPI's `{detail}` is used for the
 * message only when it is actually there.
