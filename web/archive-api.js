/**
 * archive-api.js -- the seam between the vendored Character Library frontend and
 * the archive server.
 *
 * The frontend was written as a SillyTavern extension: it addresses characters
 * at `POST /api/characters/all`, avatars at `/thumbnail?type=avatar&file=`,
 * galleries at `/user/images/<folder>/<file>`, and so on. The archive speaks its
 * own contract at `/api/v1` instead, and deliberately so -- teaching FastAPI to
 * answer `/characters/edit-attribute` would relocate the compatibility burden
 * rather than end it, which is the one thing this whole migration exists to
 * avoid.
 *
 * So the translation happens *here*, on the client, in a file we own. That
 * matters: the server contract stays clean and the ST-shaped knowledge is
 * confined to one deletable module. As the frontend gets reworked, routes come
 * out of the table below one at a time and nothing else has to move.
 *
 * WHY A FETCH INTERCEPTOR, AND NOT EDITS TO library.js
 * library.js is 29,700 lines with ~30 raw `fetch()` sites and an `apiRequest()`
 * helper on top. Rewriting them means owning a diff against a file we want to
 * keep re-vendoring from upstream. Wrapping `fetch` costs one file and leaves
 * the vendored tree byte-identical apart from the handful of changes listed in
 * VENDORED.md. The cost is that a request's true destination is not visible at
 * its call site -- which is why every route below names what it maps to, and
 * why unmapped ST endpoints fail loudly (see NOT_IMPLEMENTED) instead of
 * quietly reaching a server that isn't there.
 *
 * WRITES
 * Card edits, deletes, avatar replacement, importing a card file and gallery
 * writes map onto the archive's own write endpoints (see the WRITES section
 * below). What is still refused -- creating a card from nothing, fetching a URL
 * server-side, standalone world-info files, chats -- answers 501 with a message
 * the UI can show, because a write that silently no-ops is how an archive loses
 * data. So does any ST-shaped path no route claims: see isHostShaped.
 *
 * Two ST behaviours deliberately do NOT survive the translation:
 *
 *   - **A rename does not move the card file.** SillyTavern never renamed an
 *     avatar on a field write either, and the filename is what the frontend, the
 *     DOM and the thumbnail cache all key on. See the PUT endpoint's docstring.
 *   - **A rename does not move the gallery folder.** The archive resolves a
 *     gallery by its `gallery_id`, not by the folder's name, so the frontend's
 *     file-by-file folder rename has nothing left to do and is short-circuited
 *     in library.js.
