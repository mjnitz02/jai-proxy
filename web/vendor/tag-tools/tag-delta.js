// tag-delta.js
// Pure diff/reconstruct helpers for the persisted tag dictionary. No DOM, no
// SillyTavern globals — safe to import in a browser or run under Node.
//
// index.js persists only the delta between the shipped base dictionary and the
// user's working copy, not the whole expanded dictionary: the base can run to
// hundreds of canonicals, but a session's edits are almost always a handful of
// moves. Storing the full copy also froze a user's dictionary at whatever the
// base looked like when first seeded, since nothing distinguished "the base"
// from "what the user changed" after that. Diffing against the base at save
// time and replaying the diff over the (always-current) base at load time
// fixes both: settings stay small, and updates to the shipped dictionary keep
// flowing through for anything the user hasn't touched.
//
// Glob match rules (`*monster*`) ride through here as ordinary entries so they
// reconstruct with the rest of the mapping, but they are never diffed into the
// delta and never honoured out of it — see the isPattern() guards below. That is
// what keeps them core-dictionary-only: the delta is the only channel a user's
// edits travel through, so a rule that can't enter it can't be authored, moved
// or deleted by a user.
