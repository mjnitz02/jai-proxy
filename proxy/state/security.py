"""The login gate's configuration, persisted at `data/security.json`.

WHY THIS EXISTS
The archive has no accounts and does not want any. What it sometimes wants is a
door: one username and one password in front of the whole server, off by
default, switched on from Settings -> Security. This module is that door's
state -- whether it is on, what opens it, and how a browser that already opened
it proves so on the next request.

WHY ITS OWN FILE
`data/settings.json` is an opaque blob the client owns: `GET /settings` hands
the whole thing to the browser and `PUT /settings` replaces the whole thing from
the browser's copy. A password hash stored there would be served to every page
load, and a stale tab saving an unrelated preference would write its old copy of
the credentials back over a changed password. The gate is also the one piece of
state the *server* decides on, per request, so unlike that blob it has a schema
and the server is what enforces it.

WHAT IS STORED
Never the password. A scrypt hash with a per-password salt, and a random
`session_secret` that signs session cookies. Sessions are stateless -- a cookie
is an expiry time plus an HMAC over it -- so there is no session table to
persist or sweep; replacing the secret is how every session is ended at once,
which happens whenever the credentials change or the gate is switched off.

And, optionally, one API token: a second way through the gate for the clients
that cannot log in -- the two userscripts, which post from another site's page.
That one *is* stored as issued, because Settings -> Userscripts bakes it into
the script it generates and a hash could not be baked into anything. It sits
beside `session_secret`, which is the same kind of thing: whoever can read this
file can already mint a session. It outlives a password change on purpose (a
new password should not mean reinstalling two userscripts) and ends when it is
regenerated or revoked.

LOCKED OUT
Delete `data/security.json` (or set `"enabled": false` in it). The gate is off
when the file is absent. A file that exists but cannot be parsed keeps the gate
*closed* rather than open -- a damaged file must not be a way in -- and the log
line says which file to remove.
