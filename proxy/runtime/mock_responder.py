"""The chat upstream, replacing the MLX client.

Nothing in this project needs a language model. The `/v1/chat/completions`
route exists because pointing JanitorAI (or saucepan) at it as a custom API
provider is what makes those sites hand over a creator-hidden definition in the
system prompt -- the reply is a side effect, not the product. Forwarding to a
real MLX server for that side effect cost a macOS-only dependency and a second
process, which is the last thing that kept the server off a container.

So the reply is assembled locally out of pre-baked fragments. It is not smart
and does not read the definition it was given: it picks a beat, a line, and a
closer at random, addresses the character by the name parsed from the system
prompt, and reflects one word back from whatever was last said. That is enough
to look like a small, distracted model on the other end rather than a stub --
which matters only so a chat session doesn't visibly break mid-capture.
