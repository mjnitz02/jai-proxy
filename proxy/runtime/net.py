"""The one place an outbound HTTP client is built.

WHY THIS EXISTS
Every request this server makes to the outside world -- media downloads, card
avatars, the DataCat session, the browser's CORS passthrough -- should go
through the same optional proxy, and none of them should ever pick one up by
accident. Before this module there were five independent `httpx.Client(...)`
constructions, four of which passed `settings.http_proxy` and one of which
(`proxy.cards.avatar_fetch`) did not, and all five inherited httpx's
`trust_env=True` default -- so an ambient `HTTPS_PROXY` in the container
environment silently proxied everything whether or not the archive was
configured for it.

Both halves matter, and the second is the one worth stating plainly: `trust_env`
is pinned **off** here. The resolved proxy is the only thing that ever routes a
request, so "no proxy configured" means no proxy, and turning it off in the UI
actually turns it off.

WHERE THE URL COMES FROM
`data/settings.json`'s `httpProxyUrl`, else the `JAI_PROXY_HTTP_PROXY`
environment variable (`settings.http_proxy`), else nothing.

Reading the settings blob here is a deliberate exception to the rule
`proxy.state.ui_settings` argues for -- that the server stays ignorant of the
frontend's schema. The exception is exactly one key, read defensively (a wrong
type, an unparseable file or an unreadable disk all degrade to "no proxy"
rather than raising), because the alternative -- a second configuration surface
with its own file, endpoint and UI -- costs more than the coupling does. Nothing
else in the server may read this file; see the note in `ui_settings`.

The result is cached against the settings file's mtime and size, because
`download_batch` builds a client per run and the media job worker would
otherwise stat-and-parse the blob in a loop.
