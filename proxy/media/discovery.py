"""Media URL discovery -- salvage item 1 of docs/UI_REWRITE_PLAN.md §1.3.

A verbatim port of `extractMediaUrls` and `collectCardTextChunks` /
`findCharacterMediaUrls` from
`web/library-sections/30-media-localization-feature.js`. Discovery moves
server-side with the rest of Stage 5 (§3.4): the client no longer scans a
card's own text for image URLs, it asks `POST /characters/{id}/media/scan`.

The regexes, their order, and the final "truncated twin" dedupe step are
copied exactly -- this is the piece that cost a session to get right the
first time (see the paren-handling comments below), so nothing here is
rederived. `tests/media/test_discovery.py` ports
`web/tests/media-urls.test.js` case for case as the acceptance suite.

Everything downstream of "here is a URL" -- the guard, the sniff, the
UNSUPPORTED_EXT_RE image-only policy -- already lives in `proxy.media.writer`
and is reused here rather than duplicated.

# caller ever produced it and nothing ever recorded that it existed.

# carries against what this build can actually do with it, plus the one source
# that isn't a link (a Chub-sourced card's own first-party gallery). It is pure
# regex over strings -- no HTTP, no disk -- which is what makes it usable as the
# planner's skip check across the whole archive.
