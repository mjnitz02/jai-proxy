"""External gallery extractors -- resolve a gallery *source* into direct image
URLs (or, for MEGA, into a reference the download step knows how to fetch and
decrypt itself).

docs/UI_REWRITE_PLAN.md §3.4 dropped all seven of `web/`'s extractors up front,
"to be reconsidered server-side later, on evidence of a real card that needs it".
Stage 6B is that reconsideration, and the evidence is a scan of all 3,868 cards:

    chub gallery    318 cards, 5,247 files already downloaded under the old
                              UI (`data/galleries/*/chubgallery_*`) -- see
                              `resolve_chub_gallery` below
    mega             61 cards
    catbox album     23 cards
    imgchest         19 cards
    imgbb album      15 cards
    postimg          11 cards
    gdrive            2 cards      dropped: negligible, and the one most
                                   dependent on browser session cookies
    imgbox            0 cards      dropped: not needed at all. Every card that
                                   mentions imgbox links direct
                                   `images2.imgbox.com/...` files, which the
                                   ordinary `embedded` phase already handles.

`civitai` was added later, on the same kind of evidence arriving the other way
round: cards whose galleries silently never downloaded. It is the case that
motivated `discovery.enumerate_sources` -- a Civitai post link is neither an
image URL nor (at the time) a known album page, so *nothing* recorded that it
had been seen, and no amount of re-running the pipeline would have surfaced it.
See `proxy/media/civitai.py`.

These are emphatically *not* the media pipeline -- they are one optional phase
of it. A card's own embedded and lorebook URLs never needed an extractor, which
is why localizing kept working after §3.4 dropped these.

**Two kinds of source, one name.** `chub` and `mega` don't fit the
URL-pattern-in-card-text model the other four use -- a Chub gallery is
triggered by the card's own `extensions.chub.id`, not a link anyone wrote, and
a MEGA folder needs its content decrypted (AES ECB/CBC/CTR via `proxy.media.mega`),
not just fetched. They're still extractors in the sense that matters: each one
turns "this card has a gallery source" into a list of images the ordinary
download pipeline can save. `resolve_chub_gallery` is called directly by
`_discovered_items` (keyed on the card's Chub link, not `find_gallery_urls`);
`mega` is registered here like the other four, via `Extractor.fetch` instead of
`Extractor.parse`, since listing a MEGA folder means calling MEGA's API rather
than scraping an HTML page.
