"""Trash exact-duplicate gallery files left behind by media re-downloads.

Media occasionally gets re-fetched for a card whose gallery already holds it --
a re-run of a broken batch, a re-import, a rescan after a slight card change --
and the new download lands under a new `extgallery_<ts>_<name>.webp` /
`localized_media_<ts>_<name>.webp` filename (the timestamp in the name is a
batch position, not a content id; see `proxy/media/names.py`). The old file
stays on disk, byte-identical to the new one, just no longer named in the
gallery's `.media.json` (`proxy/media/manifest.py`) because that manifest was
repointed at the new file. Nothing else ever cleans these up, and it recurs
any time a card is rescanned, so this is exposed as a live server action
(`POST /api/v1/media/dedupe`, Settings -> Media) rather than a one-off script.

A file is only trashed when both are true:

  1. its name is not claimed by any current entry in the gallery's
     `.media.json` `files` map (i.e. nothing currently points at it), and
  2. its sha256 matches the sha256 of a file that *is* currently claimed.

That second check is the safety net -- it is what makes this "obvious
duplicate cleanup" rather than image similarity matching. A same-size,
similarly-named, or same-prefix file that isn't a byte-for-byte match of a
live file is left alone (`unresolved`), on the assumption it is a manually
added image the manifest never knew about rather than a stale re-download.
