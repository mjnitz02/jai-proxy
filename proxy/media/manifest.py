"""State for server-side media downloads (Phase 3C-1) -- docs/PHASE_3C_PLAN.md §3.

Two stores, deliberately separate:

**The per-gallery manifest** (`<gallery>/.media.json`) is what makes a
character's media state travel with its folder and survive a rename --
folders resolve by gallery id (`gallery.resolve_folder`), so the manifest
does too. A dotfile, so it is already excluded from every listing and scan
(`v1.py:list_gallery_files`, `gallery.py:_scan`). It records which source URL
became which local file (`files`), which URLs are permanently gone for *this*
gallery specifically (`dead`), a short history of runs, and -- see "The source
ledger" below -- the disposition of every media *source* the card carries
(`sources`), which is what lets a run decide it has nothing to do without
touching the network.

**The global dead-URL ledger** (`data/state/dead_urls.json`) is the
cross-character win: the same broken catbox link appears on dozens of cards,
so a URL confirmed dead once should never be re-fetched from any of them.
Ported from `web/modules/media-dedup.js`'s ledger half (`_ledger`,
`recordFailure`, `recordSuccess`, `isDead`, `deadReason`, the eviction rule)
-- same entry shape, same thresholds, same "delete on success" behaviour.
Unlike the JS version this one is never poisoned by our own missing `/proxy`
route (docs/PHASE_3C_PLAN.md §1): the writer that fills it in only ever sees
real fetch outcomes. Per §6/§9 the two old localStorage blobs are discarded,
not migrated, when this lands.

Both stores are written atomically via `edit.write_atomic` -- a reader
mid-write (the browser polling `GET .../media` while a run is in flight)
must never see a truncated JSON file.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The source ledger -- what was seen, and what we could do about it
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `files` and `dead` answer "which image URLs became which local file, and
# which are gone". Neither can express three things that turn out to decide
# whether a card is finished:
#
#   - a gallery *root* we resolved. `files` holds a MEGA folder's decrypted
#     children (`mega://handle/key`), never `https://mega.nz/folder/X#Y`; the
#     same for a Civitai post, a catbox album, a Chub project.
#   - a URL we saw and had no downloader for. This is the whole reason cards
#     with Civitai links sat un-downloaded for months without ever looking
#     broken: nothing recorded that the URL existed.
#   - a URL we saw and deliberately skipped (an mp3, under the images-only
#     policy). Not an error, not a file -- a decision.
#
# So `sources` records the disposition of every source a card carries, keyed
# by URL (or `chub:<project id>` for the one source that isn't a link anyone
# wrote). `h` is the handler id *at the time of the run*, `st` the outcome.
# Recording the handler is what makes the ledger self-healing: when a URL
# recorded `unhandled` gains a handler, that card -- and only that card --
# re-arms on the next Localize all. No version stamp, no archive-wide rescan,
# and the same mechanism covers every extractor added after this one.

    roots (`files` holds their children, never them), URLs with no handler, and
