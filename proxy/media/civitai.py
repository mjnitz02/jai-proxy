"""Civitai post/image galleries -- server-side, ported from
`~/workspaces/SillyTavern-CharacterLibrary/modules/gallery-extractors/civitai.js`.

Civitai was one of the seven extractors `docs/UI_REWRITE_PLAN.md` §3.4 dropped
up front, "to be reconsidered server-side later, on evidence of a real card
that needs it". The evidence turned up the plain way: cards whose galleries
simply never downloaded. A Civitai link is invisible to *both* halves of
discovery -- `https://civitai.com/posts/1981754` has no image extension, so
`media/discovery.py`'s regexes skip it, and until this module existed it
matched no `EXTRACTORS` pattern either. Not a failed fetch, not a dead URL: a
URL nothing ever looked at.

Like `media/mega.py`, this lives outside `media/extractors.py` because it
speaks an API rather than scraping one page, and is registered there with
`Extractor.fetch` instead of `Extractor.parse`. Unlike MEGA, what it returns
are ordinary `https://image.civitai.com/...` URLs the normal download path
fetches with a plain GET -- no pseudo-URL, no decryption. (That CDN 301s to
`image-b2.civitai.com`; `writer._fetch` already follows redirects.)

**Two hosts, merged.** `civitai.red` is the NSFW-inclusive mirror. It can
expose images hidden on the main site, while the main site can expose SFW
content the mirror filters out, so both are queried and the results merged by
image id -- exactly as the JS did. One host failing must never sink the other.

**Which API call.** The reference repo states the public API cannot look up an
image by id, and scrapes the `/images/{id}` HTML page instead. That is no
longer true (verified 2026-09-04): `?imageId={id}` answers with exactly that
one image. So both URL shapes go through the documented endpoint, and the HTML
scrape is kept only as a fallback for when the API returns nothing -- a regex
over someone else's markup is the thing you want *second*.

**Auth.** Public content needs none (also verified, `nsfw=X` included). A key
in `data/settings.json`'s root `civitaiApiKey` is sent as a bearer token when
present, which is what private/hidden content needs. The reference kept the
key in cl-helper's memory behind four routes because a browser extractor
cannot read a server's config; here the settings blob already *is* the config,
so there is nothing to set up.
