"""Per-card media status, read once and shared.

Factored out of `GET /media/status` at Stage 6B (docs/UI_REWRITE_PLAN.md) so the
archive-wide batch job can plan a run without a second sweep over every
manifest. Two callers agree on one definition of "complete":

  - `GET /media/status`, the whole map, for the UI
  - `needs_media=true` on `GET /characters`, the browse chip

The third used to be `POST /media/jobs {scope: "all"}`, deciding which cards to
skip. It no longer is: "the last run had no errors" is a statement about a run,
not about a card, and a card whose run finished cleanly against a URL list that
never contained its Civitai gallery counted as complete forever. That decision
moved into the batch planner, which reads the card and asks
`manifest.sources_satisfied` instead. What survives here is the cheap,
manifest-only half of the same idea (`_has_newly_handleable_source`), so the
chip and the status map don't keep calling those cards finished either.

The sweep costs one failed `stat` for a card with no gallery folder, the same
for a folder that was never downloaded into, and one small JSON read for a
folder that has a manifest.
