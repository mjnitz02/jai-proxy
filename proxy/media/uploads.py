"""Turning a hand-uploaded file into the bytes a media folder stores
(docs/FORKS_AND_EXTRAS_PLAN.md §9).

`proxy.media.writer` already decides what the archive keeps when it downloads
an image: sniff the bytes, refuse anything that is not an image, re-encode to
WebP unless it is animated. An upload gets the same treatment through the same
functions, so a gallery folder holds one format no matter which door its files
came in through -- and the images-only policy gains its fourth enforcement
point here rather than a second, divergent one.
