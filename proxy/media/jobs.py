"""3C-2 -- the job runner (docs/PHASE_3C_PLAN.md §7).

`media_writer.download_item` and the manifest it writes are already correct
(3C-1); the thing that was missing was a way to run a batch of them that
doesn't die when the browser tab that started it closes. `POST
/characters/{id}/media` still exists and is still correct -- it streams
NDJSON over the request's own connection, so the run is only as long-lived as
that connection. `JobStore` runs the identical per-item loop as a detached
asyncio task instead: the request that submits a job returns immediately with
a job id, and the download keeps going on the server regardless of what the
browser does next.

One job at a time, not a pool of jobs. `GalleryIndex` and the manifest dict
are built once per run and mutated in place across every item in it
(docs/PHASE_3C_PLAN.md §3's "Dedup is a scandir") -- exactly the reason
`web/modules/media-download-queue.js` already runs its own jobs strictly
serially. A single background coroutine draining one queue preserves that
invariant without a lock: two jobs against the same gallery folder can never
overlap. Within one job the items themselves do run concurrently
(`media_writer.download_batch`), which is safe for the same reason a lock
would be: only the fetch awaits, so no two items can be mid-`finish_item` at
once on this loop.

Job state (this module) is a live-progress cache, not a record of what
actually happened -- that's the manifest and dead ledger, written by `_run`
exactly like the synchronous route writes them. A job lost to a server
restart mid-run leaves the manifest showing whatever finished; nothing here
needs to survive a restart for the archive to stay correct.

        would litter the archive with empty folders and rewrite every card that
