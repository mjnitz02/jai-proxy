"""Map a Chub.ai (chub / charhub) character-card PNG export onto a clean,
SillyTavern-ready chara_card_v3 -- the fourth source path alongside
sources.janitor, sources.saucepan and datacat.

Unlike the JanitorAI paths, a Chub export is *already* a well-formed
chara_card_v3, carrying its own lorebook (`character_book`) and a rich
`extensions` block (a `chub` metadata block, a `depth_prompt` author's-note
injection, `fav`). So the import is deliberately a light touch -- a passthrough
that keeps the card almost verbatim and only:

  * sanitizes macros (typo + broken-bracket repair, pronoun fold) in the
    definition text fields and lorebook-entry content -- macros stay intact,
    there's no persona-name reversal (Chub is a fully open card, like datacat),
  * tames `creator_notes` -- Chub wraps the blurb in a page-sized styled shell
    with a `<style>` CSS block SillyTavern warns about, so the sheet is inlined
    and dropped while the layout it described survives (see notes_html), and
  * strips emoji/hash noise from tags.

Everything else is preserved AS IS: `extensions` (untouched -- including the
`depth_prompt` prompt and the `chub` block), `system_prompt`,
`post_history_instructions`, `character_version`, and the whole
`character_book`. Crucially that includes lorebook-entry fields our own
LoreEntry model doesn't carry (`priority`, `probability`, `selectiveLogic`) and
Chub's mixed int-or-string `position`. That's why the mapping edits the raw
parsed dict in place rather than round-tripping through the pydantic card models
-- a round-trip would silently drop those extras and coerce the int positions.

Identification + naming: a Chub card is recognized by `extensions.chub`. Its
`data.name`/`data.creator` are the character name and creator, and
`extensions.chub.id` (a unique numeric id, not a hash) drives the
`<name>_<id>.png` filename layout and the acquired-detection glob.
