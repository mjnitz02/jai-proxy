"""Compile the Tampermonkey bridges from their source modules, with the two
constants a user actually has to change baked in.

The bridges are authored as small fragments under `userscript/src_jai/` and
`userscript/src_saucepan/` and concatenated, in an explicit order, inside a
single IIFE. That concatenation used to live in two near-identical scripts under
`scripts/`; it lives here so the *server* can do it too -- the settings UI asks
for a configured script and gets one back, which is the only practical install
path when the archive is a container on another machine and the user is nowhere
near a checkout.

Two constants are substituted, both in `config.js`:

  * `DEFAULT_SERVER` -- where the bridge posts. Tampermonkey storage still wins
    at runtime (`GM_setValue("serverUrl", ...)`), so this only sets the fallback,
    which for a generated script is exactly the value the user was told to use.
  * `BULK_TAG_FILTER` -- the include/exclude tag filter the bulk sweep and the
    "hide saved" toggle apply. Only the JanitorAI bridge has one.

Substitution is anchored on the declarations themselves and raises if an anchor
is missing, so renaming a constant in the source breaks the build loudly instead
of silently emitting an unconfigured script.

With no overrides the output is byte-identical to the source concatenation --
that is what `make compile` writes into the repo.
