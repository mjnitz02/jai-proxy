"""Writing to the archive: patch a card in place, replace its avatar, bin it.

Three rules hold this module together, and each one exists because breaking it
would lose data quietly rather than loudly.

**A field edit never touches a pixel.** `pngtools.inject_text_chunks` rewrites
only the tEXt chunks and copies every other chunk -- IHDR, PLTE, tRNS, IDAT,
IEND -- byte for byte, so pngquant's quantized IDAT survives a card edit exactly.
Re-encoding through Pillow would inflate a 700 KB card back to 1.8 MB and strip
the card while it was at it. The one operation that legitimately re-encodes is
replacing the avatar, and it goes the other way round: new pixels, existing card
put back on top.

**Every write is atomic.** Temp file in the same directory, then `os.replace`.
A reader mid-write must never see a truncated PNG, and a crash mid-write must
leave the old card intact rather than half a new one.

**Nothing is unlinked.** Deletes move into `settings.trash_dir`, which is never
scanned, indexed or exported -- the same contract as `data/_quarantine/`. A card
deleted by a misclick is the failure an archive exists to prevent, and disk is
cheaper than the card.
