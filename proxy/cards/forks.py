"""`extensions.fork` -- the link between a fork and the card it was rewritten
from. See docs/FORKS_AND_EXTRAS_PLAN.md §3.

A fork is a whole, standalone card: nothing lazy-resolves through its parent,
and it stays a valid card if the parent is deleted. What it shares is its
parent's `gallery_id` (so gallery/expression images are never duplicated) and
what it must not share is its parent's identity fragment (the archive's dedupe
key) -- see `root_fragment` and `stamp` below.

Forking a fork is allowed, but flattened: `fork.of` always names the *root*
original's fragment, never an intermediate fork's. A rewrite of a rewrite
becomes a sibling of the existing fork, not a grandchild -- deliberately, for
a single-user library where "every fork of X" is already one lookup and a
multi-hop chain would buy nothing but complexity. See §3's "Do forks fork?".
