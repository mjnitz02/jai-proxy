"""Adopting a card PNG that arrived as a file rather than from a provider.

The `/build-*` routes each own a *site*: the browser captures that site's JSON,
a mapper in `proxy.sources` turns it into neutral fields, and the shared tail
writes the card. This module owns the other door -- a PNG handed over whole, by
a drag onto the import modal or out of a Character Library bundle -- where there
is no site to ask and the card is already embedded in the file.

Two kinds of file come through it, and the difference decides everything:

  * **A card this archive already made.** Every card written here carries an
    `extensions.jai` provenance block and nothing else does (the same test
    `scripts/import_cards.py` uses to spot an unprocessed orphan). Its text has
    already been sanitized and its pixels have already been cropped, resized and
    quantized on the way in, so it is adopted *verbatim* -- no second clean, no
    second re-encode. Re-running the image pipeline over an already-cropped
    portrait is how a bundle round-trip quietly degrades a card it was only
    meant to copy.

  * **Anything else.** A foreign card gets the full intake treatment: macros
    sanitized, creator notes tamed, tags normalized, provenance stamped, image
    normalized/cropped/quantized -- so a card that arrives this way is shaped
    exactly like one the build routes wrote.

What this module does *not* do is decide about duplicates or touch the disk;
that is the route's job (`proxy.api.v1.characters.import_character`), which owns
the archive index the fragment is checked against.
