"""How a card becomes a filename.

Two functions, kept apart from `builder` because they are the archive's naming
contract rather than part of building a card: the dedupe checks, the bulk-export
skip list, the gallery-folder resolver and the rename tooling all derive names
the same way, and none of them should have to import the builder to do it.

The filename is `<safe name>_<id fragment>.png`, and the fragment alone is the
identity -- see the dedupe rule in `proxy.cards.builder.PngWriter.find_by_id`.
