    The items are the card's own embedded and lorebook URLs plus any gallery
    source resolved through `media/extractors.py`: external album pages linked
    in the card's text (Stage 6B C3, the `extGallery` phase) and, for a
    Chub-sourced card, Chub's own first-party gallery for it (Stage 6B, the
    `chub` extractor).

    Gallery resolution costs at least one HTTP request, so it only runs for
    the minority of cards that actually have a source to resolve. Callers are
    on a worker thread or FastAPI's threadpool, which is why this is sync.

    Each item carries its *own* `prefix`, matching the class it was (or would
    have been) saved under: `localized_media` for embedded, `lorebook_media`
    for lorebook, `extgallery` for an extractor-resolved album/MEGA image,
    `chubgallery` for Chub's own gallery. `download_batch` falls back to the
    job's prefix when an item omits this key, but a `discover=true` job mixes
    all four classes in one call, and `GalleryIndex.find_by_name`'s
    priority-downgrade guard (media-dedup.js:140-145) refuses to match a
    lower-priority file (e.g. `extgallery_..._<mega-handle>.webp`, saved by
    the pre-rework browser pipeline) against a higher-priority query prefix
    like `localized_media`. Tagging every item here is what lets that guard
    still find the archive's existing gallery files instead of silently
    re-fetching and AES-decrypting all of them just to throw the bytes away
    at the content-hash step.

    The second half of the return is the source ledger's raw material: one
    record per source `manifest.effective_sources` can't derive from
    `files`/`dead` -- gallery roots with what they resolved to, URLs nothing
    here handles, and URLs the images-only policy refuses before any fetch.
    The caller writes them (`media_manifest.record_source`) once the run that
    used them is over, so a run that never happened records nothing.

    The batch download route gets this for free: it runs both checks before it
    opens a connection. The browser-fetch door (§6) can't -- by the
    time bytes reach `POST .../media/bytes` they've already been downloaded
    and, for MEGA, AES-CTR-decrypted client side. A re-run over an already
    complete MEGA folder therefore re-downloaded and re-decrypted every file
    only to be told "already have this content" 200 times. This route lets
    that caller skip on the name index exactly like the server-fetch path
    does, before a byte moves.

    Recording the match in the manifest mirrors `download_item`'s name-match
    branch: the URL *is* satisfied by that file, and `/media/status` reads the
    manifest, so a skip that goes unrecorded leaves the card looking
    permanently un-downloaded.
