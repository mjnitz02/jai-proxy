"""`/api/v1` -- browse, download and edit over the card archive.

Every endpoint here is a plain `def`, not `async def`, on purpose: they all touch
the filesystem, and FastAPI runs sync handlers in a threadpool where blocking is
harmless. Declaring them `async` would block the event loop for the duration of a
stat sweep or a 1.2 MB read, which is precisely the workload this API is made of.

This is the archive's own contract, deliberately not SillyTavern's. Teaching it
to answer `/characters/edit-attribute` would have relocated the compatibility
burden rather than ended it, so the translation lived on the client, in one
deletable file (`web/archive-api.js`) -- and was duly deleted with it. The
browser client calls these routes as they are.

The routes are grouped by resource across `characters`, `galleries`, `media`,
`system`, `network`, `userscripts`, `discover` and `duplicates`; anything two
of them need lives in `_shared`. They are assembled onto
one router here, in the order they were registered when this was a single module.
