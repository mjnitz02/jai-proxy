"""Read-only previews of a provider card, before it is anything on disk.

Discover lets you look at a card on Chub or DataCat and decide whether to keep
it. Deciding means reading it -- description, greetings, lorebook, creator notes
-- and that means mapping the provider's payload into a tavern card. That
mapping already exists, in Python, in `proxy.sources.chub` and
`proxy.sources.datacat`, and it is *the same code* `/build-chub` and
`/build-datacat` run when the card is actually written.

So the preview runs it too, rather than the browser re-implementing it in
TypeScript. The point is not to save the typing: it is that a second mapper
would drift, and a preview that disagrees with what lands in the archive is
worse than no preview. Everything below the mapper call is shared with the
build routes by construction -- `catalog.summarize_data` is the counting the
archive applies to a card on disk, called here on a card that is not.

The preview itself writes nothing, fetches no avatar and checks no duplicates.
The browser already knows what it holds (`POST /characters/have`), and
acquiring a card is a separate, deliberate action.

The one write below is the opposite decision: `/discover/ignored` records the
cards you have decided *against*, which is the only part of browsing that has
nowhere else to live. See `proxy.state.ignored` for why that list is its own
file and why it has no removal route.
