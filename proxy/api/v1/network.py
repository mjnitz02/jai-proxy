"""`/api/v1/proxy/status` -- does the configured outbound proxy actually work.

A proxy setting that is merely *stored* tells you nothing: a typo'd port, a
tunnel that died, or a URL the client silently ignored all look identical from
the settings form. So the check is empirical, and it runs two legs at once --
one through the proxy, one deliberately direct -- and compares the external
address each one reports. Only a *difference* proves traffic is being carried;
identical addresses mean the proxy is configured but not changing anything,
which is worth telling someone about rather than showing a green light for.

The echo service is api.ipify.org, the one third-party host this server calls
that is not a card source. Both legs are fetched concurrently and neither is
allowed to fail the other -- a dead direct leg (offline, or a firewall that only
permits the proxy) still lets the proxy leg report a green result.

    thing the threadpool cannot give us.

    typed work" *before* it is stored. The frontend's save path is debounced and

    racing a 400 ms timer and would sometimes report on the previous proxy. It
    tests only -- nothing is written, and omitting it reads the stored value.
