"""State and helpers shared by more than one `/api/v1` route module.

Import the module, never the names:

    from proxy.api.v1 import _shared
    _shared.thumbnail_store.get(...)

`thumbnail_store` and `job_store` are process-wide singletons that tests repoint
and the server's startup hook binds to its event loop. A
`from ._shared import thumbnail_store` freezes the binding at import time, so a
test that repoints the store would leave this module still writing into the
developer's real archive -- a failure this suite has actually had (see the note
on `archive_dirs` in tests/conftest.py).
