"""`/api/v1` media-folder routes: the image folders that hang off a card.

Two resources share one implementation here -- galleries (`data/galleries/`)
and expressions (`data/expressions/`), docs/FORKS_AND_EXTRAS_PLAN.md §2. Both
are a folder named `<Name>_<gallery_id>` and resolved by that id suffix, never
by the name -- a card rename moves nothing on disk. See `proxy.cards.gallery`.

`register_folder_routes` is the ~200 lines of list/get/thumb/upload/delete
both resources need identically; `GALLERY` and `EXPRESSION` at the bottom are
the only two places that say which is which. A change to one resource's
behaviour that should not apply to the other does not belong in this module.
