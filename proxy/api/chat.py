"""The OpenAI-shaped endpoints the two sites are pointed at as a "custom API
provider": `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions` and the `/health` probe.

There is no model behind any of this. The reply is a side effect -- what the
proxy is actually after is the *system prompt*, because a site that lets you
plug in your own model has to send the character's definition to it, and for a
hidden card that is the only place the definition is ever visible in plaintext.
The capture happens here; the answer comes from `proxy.runtime.mock_responder`.
