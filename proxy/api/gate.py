"""The login gate: one check in front of every route the server answers.

Off unless Settings -> Security has switched it on (`proxy.state.security`), in
which case a request has to carry either the session cookie a login hands out or
the same username and password as HTTP Basic. The second is for the clients that
cannot hold a cookie: the two userscripts, which post from another site's page.

WHAT IS NOT GATED
The browser client's own files. The shell and its hashed assets hold no archive
data, and the login screen is part of that client -- gating them would mean
serving a second, hand-built page just to ask for a password. So the client
always loads, asks `/api/v1/auth/session` where it stands, and shows its login
screen instead of the app when the answer is "locked". Everything it would then
fetch is behind the gate.

Besides that, only `/health` (the container's healthcheck, which has no
credentials to send) and the auth routes themselves.

WHY A MIDDLEWARE
Because the alternative is a dependency on every router, and the routers are
five files that do not share a parent: one added later without the dependency
would be an open door nobody notices. This sits in front of all of them, and
takes the set of protected prefixes from the same `ROUTERS`-derived list the
frontend catch-all uses, so a new router is covered by being registered.

Pure ASGI rather than `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, which buffers through a task group
and gets in the way of the chat route's streamed replies.
