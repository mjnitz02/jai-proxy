"""`GET|POST /proxy/{url}` -- the passthrough a provider fetch falls back to.

WHY THIS EXISTS
CharacterLibrary was written as a SillyTavern extension, and SillyTavern shipped
a CORS-proxy middleware at exactly this path, which sixteen call sites in the old
frontend reached for. Every one of them tried the provider directly first and
fell back here when the browser's CORS policy (or a provider that simply doesn't
send the header) made the direct leg impossible. After the pivot no route
answered, so that fallback returned a 404 HTML page -- which the media pipeline
then classified as a permanently dead URL, marking characters "media complete"
having never fetched a byte. The client is a different program now and the
fallback is a deliberate one (`fetchWithFallback`, frontend/src/lib/providers/
shared.ts), but the route and the reason for it are unchanged.

So this is a bug fix that predates the proxy feature, and it is also where the
configured outbound proxy earns most of its keep: browsing Chub and running the
gallery extractors is the traffic a person actually wants routed.

WHAT IT WILL AND WON'T FETCH
`proxy.media.guard` gates every request -- the same guard the server-side media
downloader uses, scheme + literal-host checks plus a DNS preflight. That is what
keeps this from being an SSRF hole pointed at the LAN it runs inside, and it is
also what stops the route being aimed back at this server's own origin.

There is no enable/disable toggle. The route is useless to an attacker who can
already reach a machine on your LAN (the guard refuses every private and
loopback target, so it cannot be used to pivot inwards), and the frontend has no
working path without it. `gatherEnvInfo`'s probe reads any non-404 as "enabled",
so the guard's 400 on a self-referential URL reports correctly.
