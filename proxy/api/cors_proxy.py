"""`GET|POST /proxy/{url}` -- the passthrough the vendored frontend has been
calling into a 404 ever since the pivot.

WHY THIS EXISTS
CharacterLibrary was written as a SillyTavern extension, and SillyTavern shipped
a CORS-proxy middleware at exactly this path. Sixteen call sites still reach for
it: `fetchWithProxy` in `web/modules/providers/provider-utils.js`, all seven
gallery extractors, three Chub modules and the media-localization section. Every
one of them tries the provider directly first and falls back here when the
browser's CORS policy (or a provider that simply doesn't send the header) makes
the direct leg impossible. With no route answering, that fallback returned a 404
HTML page -- which the media pipeline then classified as a permanently dead URL,
marking characters "media complete" having never fetched a byte.

So this is a bug fix that predates the proxy feature, and it is also where the
configured outbound proxy earns most of its keep: browsing Chub and running the
gallery extractors is the traffic a person actually wants routed.

WHAT IT WILL AND WON'T FETCH
`proxy.media.guard` gates every request -- the same guard the server-side media
downloader uses, scheme + literal-host checks plus a DNS preflight. That is what
keeps this from being an SSRF hole pointed at the LAN it runs inside, and it is
also what stops the route being aimed back at this server's own origin.

There is no enable/disable toggle. The route is useless to an attacker who can
already reach a machine on your LAN (the guard refuses every private and
loopback target, so it cannot be used to pivot inwards), and the frontend has no
working path without it. `gatherEnvInfo`'s probe reads any non-404 as "enabled",
so the guard's 400 on a self-referential URL reports correctly.
