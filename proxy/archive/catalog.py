"""The archive index: every card in `data/characters`, held in memory.

Deliberately not a database. A full scan -- decode each PNG's tEXt chunk, base64
decode, JSON parse -- costs 0.72 s warm across the whole 3,839-card archive, so
an in-memory dict rebuilt at startup and kept honest with a stat sweep is enough
indefinitely. SQLite would add a schema, a migration story and a second source of
truth to reconcile, in exchange for saving under a second once per process.

Two consequences of that choice worth stating, because they are what make it
hold up:

* **The filesystem is the source of truth, always.** The index is a cache of it,
  never the authority. A card dropped in by hand, renamed, or deleted outside
  this process shows up on the next refresh with no reindex step, which is also
  how a userscript acquisition lands in the browse grid live.
* **Summaries in memory, full cards from disk.** The index holds only what
  browsing needs (name, creator, tags, counts). A detail view re-reads and
  re-parses the one file it is about -- under a millisecond, and never stale.

Refresh is a stat of every file, comparing (mtime_ns, size) against what was
parsed last time; only changed and new files are re-read. On this archive that
sweep is single-digit milliseconds, so endpoints can call it per request behind a
short debounce rather than trusting a startup snapshot.

Cards that fail to parse are *recorded*, not skipped -- `CardSummary.error` says
why. An archive silently dropping the files it cannot read is the exact failure
an archive exists to prevent, so they surface as a data-quality view instead.
