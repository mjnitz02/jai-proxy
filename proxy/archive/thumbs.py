"""Thumbnails for the browse grid.

The archive averages 800 KB a card, so a 40-card viewport is 32 MB of PNG. The
grid cannot serve originals; it needs a small derivative of every card. What it
does *not* need is a thumbnailer built from scratch, because two populated caches
came across at cutover and cover 99.6% of the archive between them:

    data/cache/thumbs/avatar/    <- SillyTavern's thumbnails/avatar
                                    4,663 files, 10.3 KB average, keyed by the
                                    *exact* card filename. 3,823 of 3,839 cards
                                    already have one; 16 need generating, and
                                    840 belong to cards that no longer exist.
    data/cache/thumbs/gallery/   <- CharacterLibrary's user/cl_thumbs
                                    3,446 folders on the <Name>_<gallery_id>
                                    convention.

So the job is inherit, generate on miss, prune the orphans -- and one trap.

**Every inherited avatar thumb is JPEG data behind a `.png` extension.** All
4,663 of them: 96x144, progressive JPEG, named `<card>.png` because SillyTavern
names the thumb after the card and never revisits the extension. Deriving a
`Content-Type` from the extension therefore serves `image/png` for JPEG bytes on
99.6% of the archive. Browsers sniff and cope, but caches and any non-browser
client are entitled not to, so the media type here is always read from the file's
magic number and never from its name.

Avatar thumbs generated on a miss keep the card's filename rather than "fixing"
the extension. A cache where one file in 240 is addressed differently from the
rest is a worse bug than an inaccurate extension that is never trusted anyway,
and the sniff makes the inaccuracy harmless.

What they no longer keep is the JPEG: everything generated here is WebP now,
roughly half the bytes at matched quality. That is a one-way door on drop-in
SillyTavern compatibility, and taken deliberately -- host compatibility is
already out of scope. It needs no migration either, precisely because of the
sniff: inherited JPEGs and generated WebP coexist in a directory and both serve
correctly. Only the *gallery* cache carries the new format in its filenames
(`_<size>.webp`), because its geometry changed at the same time and its old
files are being purged rather than kept.

The whole directory is a cache: deleting it costs one regeneration pass, never
data.
