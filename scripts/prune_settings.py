"""Drop the dead keys the old frontend left in `data/settings.json`.

The settings blob is one opaque JSON document the server does not schema-check
(`proxy/state/ui_settings.py`), so every key the vendored CharacterLibrary
frontend ever wrote is still sitting in it -- 117 of them, including credentials
for six providers that were cut before the rewrite, a theme customizer, a mobile
mode and a duplicate-scanner's thresholds. None of it is read by anything any
more, and leaving it there makes the file unreadable for the handful of keys
that *are* live.

    uv run python scripts/prune_settings.py            # read-only report
    uv run python scripts/prune_settings.py --apply    # rewrite the file

WHAT SURVIVES
`ui2`, the browser client's own namespace, plus the root keys it deliberately
reads flat -- the provider credentials and `httpProxyUrl`, which are not
preferences this app invented but real data the old UI and the server already
share (see `frontend/src/hooks/use-settings.ts` and `proxy/runtime/net.py`).
That list is the whole schema; anything else is by definition a leftover.

THE ONE MIGRATION
`tagDictionaryDelta` is real user work -- the tag consolidation overrides -- and
it moved namespace in the rewrite: the old tag manager wrote it at the root, the
new Tags page reads `ui2.tagDictionaryDelta`. So it is moved rather than
dropped, and only when `ui2` does not already hold one (a delta edited in the
new UI always wins; the root copy is then the stale one).

This is a one-off for the Stage 7 cut-over (docs/UI_REWRITE_PLAN.md §5). It is
idempotent -- a second run finds nothing to do -- and `--apply` writes a
timestamped backup beside the file first, because the same document holds the
only copy of the Chub and DataCat tokens.
