"""Bulk-import character-card PNGs into the cards archive.

Two kinds of already-embedded PNG export are recognised when dropped into
`./import`, both re-homed into the configured cards folder as
`<name>_<id>.png` -- the exact layout and naming the native retriever produces
(see JAI_PROXY_ARCHIVE_DIR / JAI_PROXY_CARD_LAYOUT in .env.template) -- so a
landed card shows as acquired on the next scan (which keys off the `_<id>`
filename fragment):

  * datacat  -- a JanitorAI card pulled by the closed-source datacat retriever.
    It carries no lorebook, so it's rebuilt through the CardBuilder (macro
    sanitize, creator-notes cleanup) with a fresh datacat_import provenance
    block. See proxy/datacat.py.
  * JannyAI  -- a jannyai.com card export, structurally a twin of datacat
    (definition-only, no lorebook, macros intact), rebuilt the same way with a
    fresh jannyai_import provenance block. See proxy/jannyai.py.
  * Chub.ai  -- an already-complete chara_card_v3 (its own lorebook + rich
    extensions). It's passed through near-verbatim: macros sanitized,
    creator_notes tamed (layout kept, stylesheet dropped -- see
    proxy/text/notes_html.py), tags cleaned, everything else (the whole
    character_book, Chub's own extensions block) preserved as is -- plus a
    fresh `extensions.jai` provenance stamp layered on top, the same one every
    other source gets. See proxy/chub.py.

Both share the same tail: avatar normalize + pngquant compression, and a card
whose id already lives in the cards folder is skipped, never overwritten (the
one on disk may be a fuller retrieval -- e.g. a datacat import lacks the lorebook
a native pull would have). `--overwrite` reverses that for a deliberate re-import
-- after a pipeline change that alters how cards are built, re-dump the source
exports and re-run with it. The on-disk gallery_id still wins, and a card renamed
upstream has its old `<name>_<id8>.png` pruned so the overwrite can't fork.

`--fetch-datacat-images` (datacat only) turns on one extra, opt-in network
step: for each datacat card, ask datacat.run's own API (see
proxy/datacat_client.py) for the untouched original JanitorAI avatar URL, and
lead creator_notes with it -- mirroring what the native retriever already
does for its own avatar_url, so SillyTavern-CharacterLibrary's creator-notes
media scan picks up the full-resolution original as a gallery image even
though the embedded avatar here is cropped/compressed. Off by default so this
stays a pure offline batch otherwise; a card whose original can't be
recovered (gone from datacat's index, etc.) just imports without the link.

One field is the exception to never-touch: `extensions.gallery_id`, the handle a
card carries to its stored image gallery (see proxy/cards/gallery.py). A legacy export
often has one an older on-disk card lacks, so when an import matches an existing
card (same name + id) the gallery_id is *backfilled* into that card in place --
pixels and every other field untouched -- rather than the import simply being
dropped. This lets galleries be assigned to characters without re-downloading
their avatars. An id already on the on-disk card always wins, so the backfill
only reaches cards written before the writer started stamping ids (or scanned by
scripts/backfill_gallery_ids.py). To adopt a legacy export's id over one of ours,
delete the on-disk card and re-run.

A second pass then sweeps the *cards folder itself* for orphans: cards that were
dropped in by hand (a fresh export saved straight into SillyTavern) and so never
went through any of the above -- raw HTML creator_notes, unsanitized macros, an
uncompressed avatar, no `_<id8>` in the filename. They're identified by the
missing `extensions.jai` stamp every card we write carries, run through the very
same import as if they'd been staged in ./import, and the original is then
retired to `--orphan-dir` (or deleted with `--delete-orphans`) so the archive
doesn't show the character twice. An orphan we can't classify is left strictly
alone -- it may be a hand-made or SillyTavern-native card that was never ours.
Disable the pass with `--no-orphans`.

Offline batch -- it does not need the proxy server running.
