"""Write FastAPI's OpenAPI document to `frontend/openapi.json`.

Step one of two in `make api-schema`; step two runs `openapi-typescript` over
the file this writes to produce `frontend/src/lib/api-schema.ts`, which is the
only description of the server the React client ever sees.

The JSON is an intermediate and is gitignored. The generated TypeScript is
committed, and CI re-runs the whole target and fails on a diff -- that check is
what keeps the client honest against the routes, and it is the reason every API
change in docs/UI_REWRITE_PLAN.md §3 is a schema change first and a UI change
second.
