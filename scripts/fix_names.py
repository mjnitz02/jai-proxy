"""Find (and interactively repair) card names that are not actually names.

SillyTavern injects `data.name` as the character's identity -- literally
"You are <name>" -- so `Naomi  your broke roommate started an Onlyfans` tells
the model that is its name, and `Narrator` hides whoever the card is really
about. Neither defect is visible until the roleplay is already going wrong.

This scans the archive (or ./import), classifies each name via
proxy.name_repair.diagnose, and shows what it would change:

    uv run python scripts/fix_names.py                  # read-only report
    uv run python scripts/fix_names.py --dir import     # scan a staging folder
    uv run python scripts/fix_names.py --verdict generic
    uv run python scripts/fix_names.py --interactive    # confirm each rename
    uv run python scripts/fix_names.py --json out.json
    uv run python scripts/fix_names.py --stats          # how good were the rules?
    uv run python scripts/fix_names.py --rejudge        # how good are they now?
    uv run python scripts/fix_names.py --prune          # forget deleted cards

Every interactive decision -- including skips and "actually that name was
fine" -- is appended to logs/name_repair.jsonl with the diagnosis that produced
it, so the rules can be scored and improved against real judgements instead of
guesses. `--stats` replays what the rules said at the time; `--rejudge` re-runs
the *current* rules over the same cards, which is the loop to tune against.
`--no-log` opts out.

Nothing is ever renamed without a human saying so. The name engine offers
exactly the right answer about 80% of the time (see proxy/name_repair), which is
good enough to propose and nowhere near good enough to apply blindly -- so there
is deliberately no `--apply-all`. `--interactive` walks the findings one at a time
showing the alternates and a slice of the description, and accepts a typed name
for the cases the rules get wrong.

A rename rewrites `data.name` in place via pngtools.embed_card (tEXt chunks
only, so pngquant-compressed pixels survive byte-for-byte) and renames the file
to match the `<name>_<id8>.png` layout, keeping the id fragment so the card
still reads as acquired.
