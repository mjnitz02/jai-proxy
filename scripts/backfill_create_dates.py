"""Give every card in the archive a root-level `create_date`.

SillyTavern stamps `create_date` on every card it writes and sorts on it; so
does CharacterLibrary's "Date Created". Our builders never did -- see
proxy/cards/dates.py -- so every card this tool produced sorted as 0 there and
showed "(not available)" in the Info panel's Dates section.

The read path no longer needs this pass: the archive index derives the value at
parse time, so the app is already fixed. What the pass is for is the *cards
themselves*, which travel: a card exported to SillyTavern carries only what is
embedded in its PNG, and an unstamped card is undated the moment it leaves here.

    uv run python scripts/backfill_create_dates.py            # report only
    uv run python scripts/backfill_create_dates.py --apply    # write the dates

Surgical, like backfill_gallery_ids.py: the value is re-embedded into the *same*
PNG byte stream (only the tEXt chunks are rewritten), so avatar pixels and the
pngquant compression survive exactly -- verified per card by comparing the
non-text chunks before and after, which aborts the write if they ever differ.
A card that already carries a `create_date` is never touched: a recorded date
outranks a derived one, and a card that came from SillyTavern brought a real one.
Safe to re-run -- a second pass finds nothing to do.

One-time by intent. Every write funnel stamps the field now, so nothing new can
arrive without one; this exists to catch up the cards written before it did.
