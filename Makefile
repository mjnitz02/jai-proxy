# Bulk-import card PNGs from ./import into the cards folder -- datacat, JannyAI

# cards folder for orphans (cards dropped in by hand, with no extensions.jai
# stamp), imports them in place and retires the originals to state/orphans.
# Extra flags pass through via ARGS, e.g. `make import ARGS=--no-compress`.

# SillyTavern feeds data.name to the model as "You are <name>", so both wreck
# the roleplay. Read-only report by default; `make names ARGS=--interactive`
# walks the findings and applies the renames you confirm. Nothing is ever
# renamed automatically -- the suggestions are ~87% right, not 100%.
# Interactive decisions are appended to logs/name_repair.jsonl (diagnosis +
# what you actually chose), which is the ground truth for improving the rules:
# `make names ARGS=--stats` scores them against it.
