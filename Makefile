# Run the JavaScript unit tests (node:test, no deps). Two trees, run separately
# because each resolves its fixtures relative to its own directory: the

# (web/tests/).

# Bulk-import card PNGs from ./import into the cards folder -- datacat, JannyAI
# and Chub.ai exports are auto-detected (see scripts/import_cards.py). Cards
# already on disk are skipped, never overwritten. The same run also sweeps the
# cards folder for orphans (cards dropped in by hand, with no extensions.jai
# stamp), imports them in place and retires the originals to state/orphans.
# Extra flags pass through via ARGS, e.g. `make import ARGS=--no-compress`.
import:
	uv run python scripts/import_cards.py $(ARGS) --fetch-datacat-images

# Backfill `extensions.gallery_id` (SillyTavern-CharacterLibrary's per-character
# gallery handle) into any card missing one. Read-only report by default;
# `make gallery-ids ARGS=--apply` writes them in place.

# Re-audit built cards against the current macro/formatting rules. Read-only;

check:
	uv run python scripts/check_cards.py $(ARGS)

# Find card names that aren't names -- a tagline welded on (`Mia, your desperate
# roommate`) or a generic placeholder hiding the real character (`Narrator`).
# SillyTavern feeds data.name to the model as "You are <name>", so both wreck
# the roleplay. Read-only report by default; `make names ARGS=--interactive`
# walks the findings and applies the renames you confirm. Nothing is ever
# renamed automatically -- the suggestions are ~87% right, not 100%.
# Interactive decisions are appended to logs/name_repair.jsonl (diagnosis +
# what you actually chose), which is the ground truth for improving the rules:
# `make names ARGS=--stats` scores them against it.
names:
	uv run python scripts/fix_names.py $(ARGS)

# Tidy the browse grid's thumbnail cache (data/cache/thumbs/avatar): render the
# cards that have no thumb, retire the thumbs whose card is gone, and fix the
# ones whose name differs from their card's only by case -- macOS resolves those
# anyway, so they look fine here and would silently miss in a Linux container.
# The API also generates on miss, so this only ever moves work off first paint.
# Read-only report by default; `make thumbs ARGS=--apply` writes.
thumbs:
	uv run python scripts/sync_thumbs.py $(ARGS)

# Seed data/settings.json from an existing SillyTavern install: lifts the
# Character Library blob (provider tokens, followed creators, display prefs)
# out of its settings.json so the standalone browser stops depending on
# origin-keyed browser storage -- which silently held a copy left behind by
# SillyTavern itself, since its stock port is also 8000.
# Read-only report by default; `make settings-import ARGS=--apply` writes.
